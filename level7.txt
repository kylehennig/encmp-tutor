Level 7: Repetition

Background information:
Often, when programming, you will want to do something over and over again. When you know how many times you want to repeat a task, you can use what’s known as a 'for loop'. For loops are particularly useful for accessing the values in arrays.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
for number = numbers
   10 * number
end

The code inside of the for loop runs once for every number in the numbers array. In this example, each number is multiplied by ten.

Task:
Calculate the square of every single number in the numbers array using a for loop.
} end instructions

start code {
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
for ? = ?
    ?
end
} end code

start output {
ans =

     1

     4


ans =

     9
