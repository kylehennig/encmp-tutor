Level 1: Variable Assignment

Background information: 
The = operator allows you to store values as variables. Your variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet and should be descriptive.
Format: Variablename = expression

Characters and strings:
Used to display text. Strings are sequences of characters.
Express by surrounding the text in single quotations.

Note: 
Semi-colons will be discussed in Level 2 so don't use them yet!

Task:
You're walking through a garden and you see a lot of colours! In front of you there is a lion (yellow), a ladybug (red), and an elephant (grey). Using your knowledge of variable assignments and strings, assign to each animal it's colour in the order above.
