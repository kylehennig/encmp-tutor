Level 9: Multidimensional arrays.

Background information:
MATLAB is short for matrix laboratory. Thus, it would make sense if we could also store matrices as variables. Matrices are essentially two-dimensional arrays. To declare a matrix, start by declaring an array as per usual, then add a semicolon to delimit the end of each row as shown below:

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6];
This stores the matrix
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
to the variable A.

You can also perform matrix multiplication.
B = [-1 -1 0; 0 3 7; 2 2 -5];
C = A*B;
This stores the product of A and B to the matrix C.

Task:
Create a 3 by 3 matrix, A, consisting of the numbers 1 to 9 (the first row should contain 1, 2, and 3).
Multiply the matrix by the identity matrix, I, and store it to B. Do not end this line with a semicolon.
} end instructions

start code {
A = ?;
I = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1];
B = A * I
} end code

start output {
B =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     9
} end output
