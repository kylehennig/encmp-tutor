Level 6: Arrays

Background information:
When writing a program, you often want to handle large amounts of data. It is tedious to create a variable for every single piece of data you wish to store, as in the following example:

var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = 3
var4 = 4
var5 = 5

A better way to store the above data makes use of arrays. Arrays (sometimes called matrices or vectors) permit multiple values to be stored to a single variable.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The variable numbers stores all the numbers from 1 to 5. 

Task:
Create an array named 'numbers' that contains all the even numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive.
} end instructions

start code {
} end code

start output {
numbers =

     2     4     6     8    10
} end output
