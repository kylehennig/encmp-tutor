Level 11: Coming soon!

Background information:
MATLAB Tutor is a work-in-progress, and we would love for you to contribute to the levels we have available.
All our levels are loaded from .txt files in the direction you have MATLAB Tutor installed. You can open them, take a peak, and even make your own!

You will find three main blocks of text, contained by curly brackets. Anything between the opening '{' and the closing '}' can easily be edited and will be loaded by MATLAB Tutor the next time it is run.

Task:
Open one of the files level10.txt through level15.txt and create your own level. Feel free to submit it to Kyle (hennig1@ualberta.ca) or Kaitlyn (kachin@ualberta.ca), and we will gladly look into adding it to our program.
