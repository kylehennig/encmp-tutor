Level 4: Functions

Background information: 
There are many built in functions that allow us to do certain tasks in Matlab. To use a function, you write the function name followed by the arguments that you want the function to work with in parenthesis. This is called calling a function. It is possible for a function to have multiple arguments separated with a comma. 

Please note that there are many different functions to learn. In this level we only introduce you to one. 

Task: 
You can add multiple numbers using the plus function. Using this function, calculate the number of fruit you had in level 3 (5 blueberries and 1008 pears).
} end instructions

start code {
blueberries = ?
pears = ?
plus(?, ?)
} end code

start output {
blueberries =

     5


pears =

        1008


ans =

        1013
} end output
